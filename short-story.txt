Turns out I didn't read the exercise. As it stands I currently don't have a short story to commit. I'll begin with one here. I guess I began adding random sentences with random nonsense words before the exercise was posted in slack. Should've given it 15 seconds and saved myself 5 minutes. Oh well, got some practice with git.
